							<h1>Color-Sentiment in Animated Movies</h1>
							<p>This project stems from many inspirations. I'll list them, ranked in ascending order of influence.</p>
							<ol>
								<li> I'd recently picked up pixel art as a hobby. It focuses heavily on limited color palettes - in part as homage to the memory restrictions early artists had to work with, but primarily due to its necessity to the cohesion of a composition. I'd always liked how vibrant Disney movies were and thought they'd be a good source of inspiration.</li>
								<li>Someone had reminded me of that story about how Target had figured out a teenage girl was pregnant before she had. It was the application of a data analysis algorithm that grouped customers into different demographics based on previous purchases and provided coupons or ads targeted towards those demographics. It seemed a pretty nifty tool, and I wanted to find out how else I could use it.</li>
								<li>A conversation I'd had with a friend where he dismissed my critical review of live action remake of Mulan as something based entirely in nostalgia. But I knew I was right. There was something <i>verifiably</i> lack-luster about the remake. And I'd prove it to him.</li>
								</ol>
								<p>So I set out on a project that would:</p>
								<ul>
									<li> Determine the average color of every frame of a movie</li>
									<li> Plot the waveform graph of the movie's audio</li>
									<li> Depict the relation between the above points in a relatively visually appealing way</li>
									<li> And most importantly, prove my friend wrong</li>
								</ul>
					 		<h3>K-means Clustering</h3>
                			<hr class="minor" />
					 		<div class="box alt">
								<div class="row gtr-uniform">
                        			<div class="col-12">
										<p>The first step of the process was to split the video file into a series of images. I did this at a rate of about one frame per second, primarily due to memory issues my machine was having. This resulted in around 5,000 - 7,000 frames for each film. These frames were all handled a bit and then passed through <i>scikit learn</i>'s K-Means fit function with a target of one cluster. The centroid returned would be the RGB value depicting the average color of the frame. Do this for 7,000 frames and place those color side by side and you get results like the following.</p>

										<p>I know what you're thinking - I'm right. The recent release of Mulan <i>is</i> lacking something significant. The vibrant, quick scene changes with incredible color blocking  of the 1998 release are instead a muddy flood of monotonous earthy brown tones. There are some splashes of color, however. The avalanche scene and subsequent battle at the palace are somewhat distinguishable in the 2020 release.</p>

							<h3>Audio Waveform Plots</h3>
                			<hr class="minor" />
								<p>To analyze the waveform of the movie audio, I converted the movie file to a .wav format and used scipy's wavfile to read the amplitude and plot the points using numpy. I saved the plot image and made a black and white mask to overlay on the color spectrums. If I were looking for something other than aesthetics and general trends, I'd have paid more attention to ensuring frame color and audio amplitude were synchronous. Regardless, we get some pretty cool results.</p>
