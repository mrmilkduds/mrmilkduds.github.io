							<h1>Color-Sentiment in Animated Movies</h1>
							<p>This project stems from many sources. I'll list them. 1 is least influential in my choice to pursue; 3, the most.</p>
							<ol>
								<li> I'd recently picked up pixel art as a hobby. It focuses heavily on limited color palettes - in part as homage to the memory restrictions early artists had to work with, but primarily due to its necessity to the cohesion of a composition. I'd always liked how vibrant Disney movies were and thought they'd be a good source of inspiration.</li>
								<li>Someone had reminded me of that story about how Target had figured out a teenage girl was pregnant before she had. It was the application of a data analysis algorithm that grouped customers into different demographics based on previous purchases and provided coupons or ads targeted towards those demographics. It seemed a pretty nifty tool, and I wanted to find out how else I could use it.</li>
								<li>A conversation I'd had with a friend where he dismissed my critical review of live action remake of Mulan as something based entirely in nostalgia. But I knew I was right. There was something <i>verifiably</i> lack-luster about the remake. And I'd prove it to him.</li>
								</ol>
								<p>So I set out on a project that would:</p>
								<ul>
									<li> Determine the average color of every frame of a movie</li>
									<li> Plot the waveform graph of the movie's audio</li>
									<li> Depict the relation between the above points in a relatively visually appealing way</li>
									<li>Use an NLP library to analyze average sentiment of in-scene dialogue in discretized chunks</li>
									<li> Relate these sentiments to the color of the frames the scene takes place in</li>
									<li> And most importantly, prove my friend wrong</li>
								</ul>

										<p>The focus of our senior design class was energy storage systems that have applications in space exploration. On Earth we have the luxuries of infrastructure and raw materials that allows for the several hundred gigawatts of power able to be stored - 90% of which is stored in the form of pumped-storage hydroelectricity. The places humans would like to colonize in space, think the Moon or Mars, do not yet have these type of luxuries. Space also has another problem. </p>
										<p>Managing heat is a notoriously tricky thing in space. It's why the International Space Station has massive radiators and why the newly launched James Webb Telescope has a 70-foot-long sunshield. And why our team decided to focus on a device that would not only manage heat, but also use it as a method of energy storage.</p>
									</div>
									
									<div class="col-12">			<p>The key premise of our design is to use waste heat to melt a material stored inside a container. Certain materials that require a lot of energy to change phases, and conversely, give a lot of energy when that phase change reverses, are called phase change materials.</p>
										<p>In a space application, the TESS would be used on a lunar or martian colony in a fashion similar to the way the heat rejection system on the ISS works. Instead of radiating heat from electronics or solar radiation back to space, however, the heat would instead be transfered to the TESS. During periods of high thermal load, like a lunar 'day', the TESS would soak up this energy and be used during,in this example, a lunar 'night' to produce energy and dissipate stored heat.</p>
