					<p>Mob Boss started out as a Discord chat bot that would bicker with and dish out sass to my friends while I was otherwise indisposed. My creation quickly turned against me (see: right), causing me to pursue a different direction with it. Mob Boss was my first real self-driven project - requirements I decided, deadlines I derived, and features I wanted to use. I'll preen about it below, but it was a project that greatly expanded my skill set - technical and otherwise. It was the primary vehicle of my Python education. It was my introduction to data analysis and working with relational databases. It even improved soft skills like project organization and defining actionable requirements. Below are a couple features I think best exemplify the proficiencies I learned while working on Mob Boss.</p>

				<h3>MObject Oriented</h3>
				<hr class="minor" />
				<div class="box alt">
					<div class="row gtr-uniform ">
						<div class = "col-6">
							<p> Key to Mob Boss was being able to instantiate 'mobs' with bounded random variables, and store those instance on a platform independent of the main program. This required me to learn about object oriented programming - classes, constructors, destructors, the lot - as well as various ways to manage data. At first, Mob Boss was managed on an excel file the program would write to whenever changes were made. This was a slow and clunky solution as the program had to read, write to, and save the file every time a change was made to the 'database'. Another issue I imagined would happen, though it never did on the 10-20 people I deployed Mob Boss to, were data leaks resulting from multiple people trying to acess and change data from the database at once. This was where I started to learn SQL and using Python to communicate with a DBMS.</p>

				<h3>Currency Distribution</h3>

						<div class="col-6">
								<p>Another issue I grappled with was developing a currency system for Mob Boss that would incentivize participation in the form of sending messages in the server and  participating in voice calls, but disincentivize spam or any other abuse of the system my friends would leverage. To solve this, I developed a logistic function that reach max currency awarded at the length of a well-thought-out message, and then applied a normal distribution to prevent my friends from figuring out the system with too much ease. The resulting heatmap on the left shows likelihood of reward based on message length, with brighter sections representing a more likely outcome.</p>

				<h3>Game Display & User Inputs</h3>
				<hr class="minor" />
				<div class="box alt">
			  		<div class="row gtr-uniform ">
						<div class="col-9">
							<p>Writing a program that handles input from a user that is not yourself is a great character building activity in my estimation. They'll find any and all edge cases within the first few minutes of using whatever your write. During brief test runs when I released Mob Boss to my friends' servers, new bugs were being found (and abused) every half hour. While not implemented in Mob Boss, it made me appreciate error and exception handling in my programs. It also taught me the importance of mapping out intended flow of a program. Anyway, here's some pictures of when the user interface worked properly.</p>
